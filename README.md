# 200-Watt-Powerful-Bass-Boosted-Stereo-System-With-Bass-Tube-and-Speaker
This is a 200 watts stereo system, Consisting an Amplifier, preamplifier and Bluetooth system. Output is given to drive a 100watts bass tube and a 100watts SONY car speaker. Preamp, Amplifier, Bluetooth, transformer, cooling system and power supply section all these things are mounted on a 1'' wooden sheet. Weight of all this wooden sheet with components is approximately 5Kg.
All the components are easily available we just have to do soldering work and connect all the wires in proper format. At all, to build this we need some basic tools like:

1) Drill machine

2) Soldering Iron

3) soldering wire

4) glue gun

5) wire cutters

6) Hot air sleeves

7) tape and wires
8) amplifier
9) This is a Class B 200watt stereo amplifier. Consisting 2sc5200 and 2sa1943 as power transistors. Driven by BD139 and 140 transistors NPN and PNP respectively. To power this amplifier system we need a 40-0-40 transformer (10ampers). Power supply section came inbuilt in my board, Kelton capacitors are there for filtration ripples from Dc voltage. Overall this amplifier is simple but powerful and build quality is quite good. A big heatsink is there to dissipate the heat, but I think this is not enough. Class B amplifier have some thing like heat problem, so we can attach a fan or water cooling system in order to keep the transistors life more.
10) trabsformer
11) Here we are using a 24-0-24 Iron core big transformer with one extra 12v output for basic circuits( Preamplifiers and blue tooth). but this amplifier can take up to 40-0-40 @10amps. more the power input / more will be the output. But with this 24 volt transformer my board providing me 200watts on speaker output.

cooling system
Our amplifier has one heatsink only, If we are in the mood to listen more loud with full bass/punch then there will be heat problem. It can be dangerous, first heat will kill the power transistors and then the speaker. so we need an extra heatsink with a fan and switch. so that we can turn on/off the fan in such condition. just apply some heatsink paste and fix another heatsink with the system.

In this system, I connect a bluetooth so that we can play wirelessly, also it is safe to connect rather than a wire with mobile. So just connect module, give power to it +5v and connect the wires directly to amplifier input. A switch is provided to turn on/off the bluetooth module, in case if we want to play with wired system directly from TV.

here is the connector for speaker, instead connecting directly wire to amplifier speaker output this connector is given. So that we can change the speakers and the system became handy too. Although having a weight of 5kg.

A 200watts bass tube with a load of 4ohms and a similar load Sony speaker is connected for better sound and 3d sound. which makes the system to provide surround sound at all. This speaker is fixed in a wooden MDF box ( Homemade) and the bass tube is made with round shaped heavy duty cardboard/ particle board.

Good, homemade, budget and bass boosted all things just in a one system. Also car friendly, TV friendly, Mobile friendly and awesome power. I am not in condition to purchase a big stereo system with costly bass tube and speakers so I made this one. Bass tube is made with submersible motor protection cover.

After searching a little bit and arranging sections from different books, this is our final schematics. 4 transistors for input stage, Two high power transistors for voltage gain stage, 2 High power NPN/PNP pair for Driver stage and then main power transistors. Through this schematics it is fully understandable, Also this is 100% working.

Using the schematics, I designed this PCB and turn it into Gerber format so that we can easily order it from any PCB Manufacturer service. To get the PCB Gerber you can comment below and follow us on Instagram Sagar_Saini_7294.
